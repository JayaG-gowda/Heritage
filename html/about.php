                        Karnataka also known as Karunadu, formerly Mysore State, is a state in the southwestern region
                        of India. It was formed as Mysore State on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States
                        Reorganisation Act, and renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state was part of the Carnatic region in
                        British terminology. Its capital and largest city is Bengaluru (Bangalore).<br><br>Karnataka is
                        bordered by the Lakshadweep Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north,
                        Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala
                        to the southwest. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other four
                        southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791 km2 (74,051 sq mi), or 5.83
                        percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the sixth-largest Indian state by area.
                        With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth-largest state by
                        population, comprising 31 districts. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the
                        most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include
                        Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kodava and Beary. Karnataka also
                        contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily spoken.

                                The era of Kannada newspapers started in the year 1843 when Hermann Mogling, a
                                missionary from Basel Mission, published the first Kannada newspaper called <i>Mangaluru
                                    Samachara</i> in Mangalore. The first Kannada periodical, Mysuru Vrittanta Bodhini
                                was started by Bhashyam Bhashyacharya in Mysore. Shortly after Indian independence in
                                1948, K. N. Guruswamy founded The Printers (Mysuru) Private Limited and began publishing
                                two newspapers, Deccan Herald and Prajavani. Presently The Times of India and Vijaya
                                Karnataka are the largest-selling English and Kannada newspapers respectively.
